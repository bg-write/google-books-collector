    Welcome! \U0001F4DA This simple CLI app for querying Google Books was built by Brady Gerber with the Click python package. In your terminal, please type out "python3 books.py", one of the below commands, and press Enter (Ex: "python3 books.py view" or "python3 books.py search harry-potter 10").\n
    To search for a book, type in what you wish to find (replace spaces with dashes) and the number of books you want to return (up to 40 books per search).
    To exit your search at any time, use "ctrl + c."\n
