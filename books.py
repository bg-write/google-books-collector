    Welcome! \U0001F4DA This simple CLI app for querying Google Books was build by Brady Gerber with the Click python package. To use this app, in your terminal, type out "python3 books.py" and one of the below commands (EX: "python3 books.py view" or "python3 books.py search harry-potter 10").\n
    To search for a book, type in what you wish to find (replace spaces with dashes) and the number of books you want to return (up to 40 books per search).
    To exit: "ctrl + c."\n
    Happy reading!\n
