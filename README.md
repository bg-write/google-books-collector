# Brady Gerber's Google Books CLI Collector

First draft completed June 16, 2021. Second draft completed June 29. Worked on this app locally before creating this repo on June 15th.

## Getting Started

1. Install the Click python package: "pip install click"
2. View the app: "python3 books.py"
3. Follow the prompted instructions
4. Enjoy!

## Technologies Used

- Python
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)
- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
- GitHub
- Git
- Visual Studio Code
- Google
- Coffee
- Breaks

## Updates Make for Second draft
- 

## Next Steps (Icebox)

- Further refactor and break down the search command algorithm (can always simplify).
- Add ability to remove specific books from current reading list (a "remove" ability was not requested in this specific technical assessment)
- Better account for user mistakes and error handling while searching for books. Ex. typing in "harry potter" instead of "harry-potter", searching for more than 40 books in one search, adding the same book twice.
