2. View the app: "python3 books.py"
3. Follow the prompted instructions
4. Enjoy!

## Technologies Used

- Python
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)
- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
- GitHub
- Git
- Visual Studio Code

## Updates Make for Second draft
- 

## Next Steps (Icebox)

- Refactor and break down the search command algorithm.
- Add loops to the search command to allow users to add more than just one book to their reading list; encountered a bug here and ran out of time to address this for the first draft.
- Store updated user data from the search command into the reading list found in the view command.
- Better account for user mistakes and error handling while searching for books - Ex. typing in "harry potter" instead of "harry-potter".
