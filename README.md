# Google Books Click Collector (CLI App)

A lo-fi CLI app for querying the Google Books API with the Python Click package.

## Getting Started

1. Install the Click python package: "pip install click"
2. Launch the app: "python3 books.py"
3. Follow the prompted instructions
4. Enjoy!

## Technologies Used

- Python
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)
- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
- GitHub
- Git
- Visual Studio Code
- Google
- Coffee
- Breaks

## Next Steps (Icebox)

- Add the ability to remove specific books from current reading list.
- Better account for user mistakes and error handling while searching for books. Ex. typing "harry potter" instead of "harry-potter", searching for more than 40 books in one search, adding the same row twice instead of just the same book title twice (and letting a user add another book instead of exiting the script).
